              "'**Calculating Pi using Python**\\n\\nPi (π) is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle\\'s circumference to its diameter. Here\\'s a simple and efficient way to calculate an approximation of pi using Python.\\n\\n### Using the Monte Carlo Method\\n\\nThe Monte Carlo method is a computational algorithm that uses random sampling to approximate a value. In this case, we can use it to estimate pi by generating random points within a square and checking if they fall inside a quarter-circle inscribed within it.\\n\\n```python\\nimport random\\nimport math\\n\\ndef estimate_pi(num_samples):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Estimate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    num_samples (int): The number of random points to generate.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    points_inside_circle = 0\\n\\n    for _ in range(num_samples):\\n        x, y = random.random(), random.random()\\n        distance = x**2 + y**2\\n        if distance <= 1:\\n            points_inside_circle += 1\\n\\n    return (points_inside_circle / num_samples) * 4\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nnum_samples = 1000000\\napprox_pi = estimate_pi(num_samples)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {num_samples} samples: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code generates `num_samples` random points within the square (-1, -1) to (1, 1) and checks if each point falls inside the quarter-circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of samples multiplied by 4 gives an approximation of pi.\\n\\n### Using the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Formula\\n\\nThe Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formula is another way to calculate pi. It\\'s a spigot algorithm that uses a series expansion to generate the digits of pi.\\n\\n```python\\ndef bbp_pi(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula for pi.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    n (int): The number of terms to use in the series expansion.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    pi = 0.0\\n    for k in range(n):\\n        pi += (1 / (16 ** k)) * (\\n            4 / (8 * k + 1) -\\n            2 / (8 * k + 4) -\\n            1 / (8 * k + 5) -\\n            1 / (8 * k + 6)\\n        )\\n    return pi\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nn = 100\\napprox_pi = bbp_pi(n)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {n} terms: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code calculates an approximation of pi using the BBP formula with `n` terms.\\n\\n### Using the Gauss-Legendre Algorithm\\n\\nThe Gauss-Legendre algorithm is another method for calculating pi. It\\'s a recursive algorithm that uses an iterative process to improve the estimate of pi.\\n\\n```python\\ndef gauss_legendre(n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculate pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm.\\n\\n    Args:\\n    n (int): The number of iterations.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n    float: An approximation of pi.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    a, b = 1.0, (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2.0\\n    t = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 4.0\\n    p = 1.0\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        a, b = (a + b) / 2.0, math.sqrt(a * b)\\n        t -= p * (a - b)\\n        p *= 2.0\\n        a = a + t / p\\n        b = math.sqrt(b - t / p)\\n    return a * b * 16.0\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nn = 100\\napprox_pi = gauss_legendre(n)\\nprint(f\"Approximation of pi with {n} iterations: {approx_pi}\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code calculates an approximation of pi using the Gauss-Legendre algorithm with `n` iterations.\\n\\nRemember that these are simplified examples and may not be the most efficient or accurate methods for calculating pi. For more accurate calculations, you can use specialized libraries or software.'"
